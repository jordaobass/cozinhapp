# Cozinhapp üç≥

This is a reinvention in Next.js of the idea by [Deleon Simoni](https://github.com/orgs/nexttag/people/deleonsimoni). The original project can be found at [CozinhApp](https://github.com/deleonsimoni/CozinhApp). 

This project is supported by **Nexxtag**.

## Why Use Next.js? üöÄ

Next.js is a powerful React framework that allows developers to build highly performant web applications with ease. Here are some reasons to choose Next.js:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improve SEO and performance by rendering pages on the server.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time for fast page loads.
- **File-based Routing**: Simplifies routing by using the file system to define routes.
- **API Routes**: Easily create API endpoints within your Next.js application.
- **Fast Refresh**: Enjoy a fast development experience with instant feedback as you edit your code.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started üíª

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
